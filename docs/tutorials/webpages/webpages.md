## How to make a webpage from Github!

*By Kirstin Petersen August 10th, 2017*

### Starting a Github account
Your team and all the members must create a GitHub account and make a basic website. We will use GitHub to share and save code (source control), and to manage the website. *At the end of this class, these repositories will be cloned to the class Github account so don't upload any information you don't want to share. You will be required to share all code and design files at the end of the class, however.*

To create a GitHub account go to github.com and request a private account via the educational discount (https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new). 

### Making your website

You can find helpful information [here](https://pages.github.com/), but the basic steps are to:

* Make an index.md file in the root of the repository or in the docs folder, Github will automatically recognize this as your home page.

* Next, navigate to the settings tab in Github and choose the source of the github page.

* Now you can find your webpage on a link related to your login name + '.github.io/' + repository name. Fx: https://cei-lab.github.io/ECE3400-2017-teamAlpha/

* You can use the same menu to choose from a large variety of themes.

* Be aware that although the site updates immediately, not all browsers update the sites appropriately. It make take several refreshs, or a new window to see your changes.

* You can use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) to write simple webpages, or you can choose to use html, although we will only be able to provide limited support for you if you do so.
