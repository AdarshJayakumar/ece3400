# ECE3400 Semester Grades

The final semester grade will depend on multiple factors including lab solutions, how well you do in the final competition, websites, and team work. The details can be found below. Be aware that the standard Cornell rules of [ethical conduct](https://www.dfa.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/policy/vol4_6.pdf) apply, and that you can fail the class if you miss more than 2 mandatory meetings.

A total of 200 points will be given, these correspond to the following grades. Please be aware, that the grading system is new, and that we may end up rescaling the spectrum during the semester.

Score | 200-185 | 184-170 | 169-155 | 154-140 | 139-125 | 124-110 | 109-95 | 94-80 | 79-65 | 64-50 | 49-35 | 34-20 | 19-0
----- | --------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------
Grade	|    A+   |    A    |    A-   |    B+   |    B    |    B-   |  C+    |   C   |   C-  |  D+   |   D   |  D-   |   F 

The score is calculated like this:

* Each [lab](Lab_score.md) counts up to 20 points
* Each [milestone](Milestone_score.md) counts up to 10 points
* The [final competition](Final_Competition.md) gives up to 20 points 
* The final robot design gives up to 25 points
* The final webpage gives up to 20 points
* Team work scores give up to 15 points

The following sections describe each scheme in detail.


## Grading of the Final Competition

The final competition follows a detailed grading scheme that is explained [here](Final_Competition.md)

## Grading of System Design and Documentation

_The TA's will award up to 25 points for good system design._

All members on a team will not necessarily be awarded the same number of points.

To earn these points you can for example implement electronic circuits that improve the accuracy of the maze mapping, efficient search strategies, nice FPGA implementation and a great screen display, or new mechanical components to make the robot faster or easier to maintain. If you have tons of spare time, consider using two cooperative robots to map the maze. The sky's the limit!

_The TA's will also award up to 20 points for good website design and documentation._

This will especially pertain to the work done after the labs towards the milestones and the final system design. Examples of things they will assess include:

* Good introductions and problem motivations
* Clarity and thoroughness of documentation
* Intuitive and nice layouts
*	Use of the right tools for analysis and unit testing
* Presence of schematics when applicable
* Presence of simulation results when applicable
* Presence and evaluation of experimental results
* Use of graphs and tables to display results, as well as proper axis and unit labeling
* Presence of design flaws
* Comparative discussion of simulation and experimental results
* Presence of conclusions
* Presence of suggestions for future work/improvements
* You can also gain extra points by making good general tutorials for students in future semesters to use. These tutorials may for instance include ways to implement PID control, in-depth tutorials on ATmega timers, new ways to make 3D parts, etc. 

## Grading of Team Work 

15 points will be given through self-assessment within the team.

Three times over the semester we will practice giving and receiving constructive criticism. The point is not to complain, but to make sure everyone contributes their best towards the final project. Each student will be asked to distribute 100 points between their team members dependent on their contribution to the team work. The accumulated points will be normalized to the group size and scaled to between 0 and 10 points towards the final grade.

Each team will meet with the professor and discuss the reasoning for their point distribution. Remember that many qualities can be considered a valuable contribution to a team: technical strength, dedication/persistence, optimism, creativity, leadership and maintaining a perspective, role of initiation, and detail oriented thinking.
