# ECE 3400, To Do list, Summer 2017

* Update lab1 hand-out - done!
* Write up lab1 on TeamAlpha website - done!
* Should lab1 also include addition of line sensors? 

* Update lab2 hand-out + new FFT code?
* Write up lab2 on TeamAlpha website - in progress, RH
* Lab2 will have half a team working on the microphone, the other half working on the treasures.
* In future versions of the course, consider changing the second half to focus on IR circuits, and make light interference on the track so they'll need to use fft.

* Update lab3 hand-out + new FPGA code - Claire
* Write up lab3 on TeamAlpha website - Claire
* Add speaker assignment for lab 3, team 1 - in progress, CC

* Update lab4 hand-out + code?
* Write up lab4 on TeamAlpha website - in progress, RH

* Make GitHub tutorial
* Make critical copying tutorial (use fft as example, sloppy written code found online) - Ryan
* Make tutorial videos for 3D printers
* Make tutorial videos for laser cutter
* Make tutorial videos for PCB
* Make tutorial for Quartis (Claire)
* Make site explaining how to do a basic PCB in Eagle
* Make site explaining how to do a basic part in Solid Works
* Make robot parts in Solid Works
* Make new mazes, order material
* Make simulation framework to test the search strategy
* Prepare Duffield Hall arena

* Buy Cornell owned Github account
* Buy tablet for digital notes
* Setup computers with 3D printers/laser cutter - in progress, GM
* Decide on schedule (lectures, labs, checkpoints, TA sessions, etc.)
